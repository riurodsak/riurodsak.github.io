&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently written together with &lt;a href="https://julesh.com/">Jules Hedges&lt;/a> about Reinforcement Learning using the Categorical Cybernetics framework (you can find the ACT2024 paper &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02688">here&lt;/a>).
Here I would like to talk about the main construction, which I like to refer to as the &amp;ldquo;RL lens&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In modelling disciplines, one often faces the challenge of balancing three often conflicting aspects: representational elegance, the breadth of examples to capture, and the depth or specificity in capturing those examples of interest.
In the context of reinforcement learning theory, this raises the question: what is an adequate ontology for the techniques involved in agents learning from interaction with an environment?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
